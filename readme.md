# PyMagnitude Tutorial  
Welcome to this PyMagnitude tutorial! In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of using the PyMagnitude library for working with word embeddings.  
## Installation  
You can install PyMagnitude via pip:  
```bash 
pip install pymagnitude 
Getting Started 
First, let's download a pre-trained word embedding model. In this example, we'll be using the GloVe embedding, but you can use any embedding you like. You can download the pre-trained GloVe embedding from this link.  Once you've downloaded the embedding, you can load it into your Python code using the Magnitude class:
